Vehicles

Create OOP classes structure based on description below. Remember to use proper elements of oop paradigm (like classes, abstract classes, interfaces) Notice, that description below is simplified by purpose, it’s goal is to check your ability to think in oop way, not to focus on it’s factual accuracy :wink: 

Description

People created many different vehicles for different purposes. All vehicles have in common a few basic attributes like manufacturer, name of model or color. Every vehicle is able to move and make sound, but they are doing it differently, according to type or model. We can actually simplify situation to statements below:

Vehicles moves (differently, according to type) and make sound (according to type, as well) 
Land vehicles moves with wheels (method returns string “Move on the wheels”)
Family car makes the sound “Pip pip!” (method returns string “Pip pip!”) 
Truck makes the sound “Bu bu!” (method returns string “Bu bu!”)

Water vehicles moves on water (method returns string “Move on the water”)
Motorboat make sound “Plum plum”  (method returns string “plum plum”)

Air vehicles moves in the air (method returns “fly!”)
Heli makes sound “Fru fru fru” (method returns “fru fru fru”)
